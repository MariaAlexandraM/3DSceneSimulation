# 3D Scene Simulation

## Description
A 3D rural scene simulation created using Blender and rendered with OpenGL, GLFW, and GLM.
The project focuses on realism and interactive control, allowing users to navigate the scene dynamically.

## Purpose
The main goal is to generate a photorealistic representation of a farm landscape, where users can explore using mouse and keyboard controls.
The scene includes: farm structures, animals, natural elements; open sourced 3d ojects, with reference links in the documentation ([`Doc.pdf`](Doc.pdf)).

## Features
- 3D Object Rendering: Models loaded dynamically.
- Camera Movement: Control with W, A, S, D keys and mouse.
- Lighting Effects: Global illumination applied.
- Environmental Effects: Fog (F for more, G for less) and shadow effects for increased realism.
- Basic Animation: One duck moves dynamically across the land.
